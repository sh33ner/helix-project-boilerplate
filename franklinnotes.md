# Franklin Notes

## Breaking Down a Customer Site for Franklin
Discussed with charity.

Part of this is inspecting each component on a page and listing them out. What do they use that's the same? (Are multiple components column sections? Are they cards?) How do they vary them? 

EF Home Page
1. Carousel
2. Column Block (parenthesis give it the same name and add a columns)
3. Let's build on what you've accomplished - 3 columns, look around and see if they use this pattern anywhere else. It's own section with 100% wide with it's own dashes to set it's own background color.
4. Columns - 2 rows of columns of 4. Could be a flexbox.
5. Columns - 3 Columns to single same width of the text.

Look for a repeated component. If you see that a lot, you can turn it into a fragment where they only have to do one of those instead. Play with adding sections and the section bar. These can be styled.

Also, in the boilerplate project the hero was loaded very first to keep the FCP fast. That's why it's not it's own component.
